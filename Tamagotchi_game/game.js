//CREATE FUNCTION FOR EACH CHARACTER
//BABY GARFIELD 

//**figure it out**
//must have a function to trigger phrases. i.e if boredom increases by num then prompt msg "play"
//Set an interval to increase metrics 
//Conditional statements: if user plays, boredom should decrease, will calm Garfield down, but user must keep an eye on other metrics (hunger, sleepines)
//add a function for Garfield to morph at a certain age 
//function to move Garfield around the screen depending on its behavior forcing the user to click the buttons to calm him down 
//Make the game user-friendly, maybe start slow and then as Garfield gets older increase the interval 
//function for the game to end or win 


//**QUESTIONS 
// - how to link JS to HTML so numbers change? go over DOM ? 
// - how to add animated background ? 
// - Interval ? review Sat Class notes
